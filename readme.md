# Profile Switches

A local plugin for Moodle 2.3

## Use

This local plugin adds the following to the user's profile section of the settings block:

* 'editor on/off' - switches the HTML editor (TinyMCE) on or off
* 'AJAX on/off'   - switches AJAX functions (e.g. dragging and dropping blocks) on or off

This setting affects HTML editor or AJAX across Moodle for that user.
